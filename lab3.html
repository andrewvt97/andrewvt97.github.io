                <p> I began my professional career as a sophomore in college, joining the Office of Academic Support at
                    the College of Staten Island as a tutor in computer science and math. I tutored other college students 
                    in algebra, calculus 1 and 2, intro to
                    computer science, networking, and data structures. Soon after, I received an opportunity to participate in the 
                    CUNY Career Launch program as a software engineering intern for the summer of that year, and join a startup 
                    in New York City called Unadat, a company that seeks to promote financial responsibility with 
                    custom goal saving plans. I worked on allowing users to creating saving challenges as part of an Agile team using Asana.
                    The following summer, I joined Walmart Global Tech in Bentonville, Arkansas as a software engineer. 
                    I worked full-stack with Spring Boot and SQL, as well as React. There, I worked
                    with a team in the accounts receivable department using Jira. Most recently, I have started research in machine learning. 
                    Under the guidance of my advisor, Dr. Yumei Huo, I analyzed two million rows of housing data in New
                    York City and built a model using Random Forest Regressor that estimates the price of a house as a tool to assist
                    buyers and sellers of real estate.
