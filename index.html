        <h2 style="text-align: center; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0.1em;"> About Me</h2>
        <p style="text-align: center;"> Hi! I'm Andrew Thomas, a full-stack developer with a passion for problem solving and creative thinking. I am currently a senior studying computer science 
            at the College of Staten Island as part of the Macaulay Honors College. I am skilled in
            a number of programming languages and technologies including C++, C, Java, Javascript, Python, React, Node, Git, Github, SQL, HTML, and CSS.
            I have used these skills to develop several projects including a drawing application, an application for musicians to learn harmony, and a full-stack
            application that allows readers to simplify or translate texts in pdfs for better readability. In addition, I am also involved in research focused on 
            machine learning. Currently, I am using models to predict house pricing in New York. I also am the president of the CSI Computer Science Club, where I 
            host workshops and knowledge-based games on computer science. I began my professional career tutoring college students in computer science and math, then went on
            to a software engineering internship at a startup called Unadat, before my most recent internship with Walmart Global Tech where I built an API and created 
            a page implementing its functionality for the accounts receivable team.     
        </p>
